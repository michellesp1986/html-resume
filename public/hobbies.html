<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Drawing and painting</h2>
    <p>Spring is the perfect time of the year to go to the shore and start drawing. I look forward to spending
        hours improving my drawing skills. These are my artworks from the last 2 years:</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>My favorite book is "One Hundred Years of Solitude" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. This novel has been part of my life for the last 20 years in which I have read it 5 times.</p>
<h2>Working out</h2>
    <p>This is the perfect way for me to keep a good body and mental health.</p>
